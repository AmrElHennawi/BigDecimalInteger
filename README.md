# BigDecimalInt

## Overview
The `BigDecimalInt` program is designed to perform arithmetic operations on large numbers that exceed the capabilities of the standard C++ library. It supports addition, subtraction, and comparison operations for numbers represented as strings or integers.

## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to provide a custom implementation for handling large numbers and performing arithmetic operations on them. It utilizes a custom class named `BigDecimalInt` to encapsulate the functionality.

## Features
- Addition (`+` operator)
- Subtraction (`-` operator)
- Comparison (Less than `<`, Greater than `>`, Equal to `==`)
- Assignment (`=` operator)
- Size retrieval (`size()` function)
- Sign retrieval (`sign()` function)

## Valid Input
The input numbers must be valid integers or strings representing integers. The program uses regular expressions to validate the input, ensuring it adheres to the format `[+-]?[0-9]+`.
